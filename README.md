#### Brief Description of Project 
##### This is a mobile application for a Online Saloon Appoinment System. That allows a customer to register and place an appointment to a saloon of choice. The customer can select a saloon, then place a appoinment on what services the customer requires and select a time for the reservation and proceed with the checkout. The customer can also manage any appointments placed by changing the date and time or cancelling the appointments.

##### The system will also allow the saloons to create an account, add the services provided with the timetable based on availability. The system will allow the saloon to manage their timetables, services and account. Additionally, the system will display the available appointments to the saloon.
